Native to Asia and Africa.
Slow growing.
Scented flowers.
Sensitive to draught.
This plant is sensitive to over-watering. This may be the cause if the buds start to fall off.
Flowering plants bloom between a few days and several months depending on the quality of care.
Give your plants a boost with fertilizer every month. If you notice that the plant has gone dormant, leave it be until next season.
IKEA provides all potted plants with nutrient-rich soil, repotting is not needed until 1 year after purchase.
Remove dust every now and then in order to allow the plant to get as much light as possible.
The height of the plants can vary.
